            <!--This is a simple introduction.-->
            <p>Tamagoyaki is Japanese rolled omelettes. It is a quite common food in Japan.
                Japanese usually eat it for breakfast or lunch.
                You can make it with just eggs, sugar, soy source, and oil.<br>
                Then, let's cook!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="in_list">
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon soy source</li>
                <li>oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol class="pre_list">
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine eggs, salt, sugar and soy sauce. Mix until everything is dissolved.
                </li>
                <li>Heat a tamagoyaki pan* over medium-high heat. Drip a little oil into the pan.
                <br>*If you don't have a tamagoyaki pan, you can use a frying pan.</li>
                <li>Pour a third of the egg mixture into pan and quickly swirl to cover the entire pan.</li>
                <li>When the egg is half-set, gently roll the egg.</li>
                <li>With the rolled egg still in the pan, pour in another third of the egg mixture. When the egg is
                    half-set, roll the omelette toward you. Repeat with the rest of the egg mixture.</li>
                <li>Slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
